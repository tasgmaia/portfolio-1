Since 2007 I’ve been managing a digital portfolio of digital and analogic photography that has been viewed more than 250,000 times on Flickr.

I love all aspects of the photographic process. From connecting with moments and capturing it with sensibility and precision. To spending hours perfecting the post-production and curating a collection, that [hopefully] allies technical quality with meaning.
